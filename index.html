        <p>Hello, my name is Brennan Benincosa and i am from Surprise Arizona, I enjoy the outdoors especially when it
            involves camping or going to the shooting range with friends! I also enjoy watching movies and playing video
            games from time to time. I am currently
            studying Web Design at BYU Idaho through the BYU Pathways Program. I am
            looking forward to learning and developing new skills! I hope with the time and effort i put into these
            classes that i will be able to find and apply to jobs that I can turn into a career.</p>
