    <h2>W01 Learning Activity: Working with Web Images</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Most websites contain not only words, but also images. Some image formats are better suited for the
      web than others. This activity introduces using images for the web and how
      to optimize images so that they use less memory, thus supporting smaller page weights, which decreases the overall
      download time.
    </p>

    <h4>Image Types</h4>

    <p>The following video introduces the popular types of images used on the web.</p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <p>As described in this video, the most common types of images for the web are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>JPEG / JPG</strong>: Typically used for photographs and complex images. Uses a compression that looses
        some information but can greatly reduce file size.</li>
      <li><strong>PNG</strong>: Typically used for graphics, logos, and images requiring a transparent background. Uses
        compression that does not lose information and supports alpha transparency.</li>
      <li><strong>GIF</strong>: Typically used for small animations and simple graphics. Limited to 256 colors, but does
        support basic transparency and animations.</li>
      <li><strong>WEBP</strong>: A more modern format that supports better compression than JPG and PNG while also
        providing for animation and transparency. Can be used as an alternative to JPG and PNG, but it is not quite as
        popular at this point.</li>
      <li><strong>SVG</strong>: Typically used for logos, icons, and text that need to scale cleanly to any size.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Including Images on a Web Page</h4>
    <p>Once you have the image you would like to include on your page, you use the image tag as follows:</p>

    <pre><code class="image">&lt;img src=&quot;temple.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the temple.&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;our-process.png&quot; alt=&quot;A graphic describing the company&apos;s process&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Company logo&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>Notice that each of these examples uses a different type of image format. You do not have to do anything
      different in the html to use them. You just include the file name.</p>

    <p>Also, remember that the <code>alt</code> text is very important for many reasons including, to provide a
      description of the image in case it does not load right away, to provide information for robots that might crawl
      your page, such as for search engine optimization, and for users that may need screen readers to access your
      content.</p>


    <h4>Image Optimization</h4>
    <p>It is important to make sure that the images you include on your page are optimized for a good user experience.
      If you have images that are very large, it will take longer to load the page and will require your users to use
      more data.</p>

    <p>The following video shows how to optimize images using the free online tool <a href="https://squoosh.app"
        target="_blank">Squoosh.app</a> .</p>

      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Three Basic Steps of Image Optimization</h4>
    <p>The original photos that we use are often large in terms of dimensions and file size. Large photos need to
      be scaled down and optimized to a size that is actually needed on a web page. The optimal size is determined by
      the design and layout of the page. Software can be used to crop, reduce, and optimize the images.</p>

    <p>These are the basic steps of image optimization:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Crop</strong> the original image to focus on the most important content.</li>
      <li><strong>Resize</strong> the image to the maximum size that is required in the design of the web page.</li>
      <li><strong>Reduce the quality</strong> of the image to an acceptable level which will reduce its file size.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="callout info">
      <p>Optimizing images is an easy way to improve page performance without requiring a
        significant time investment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <p>For this course, all images must be optimized in order to reduce overall page weight (the download size of the
        page). The standard for this course is that all images need to be less than <strong>100kB</strong> in memory
        size. If you have an image that is larger than 100kB, you will need to reduce its size by optimizing it.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Activity Instructions</h3>
    <p>For this activity you will optimize a large image and include the smaller version on a web page.</p>

    <p>There are many applications that can be used to edit and optimize images. In this activity, you will use the
      free, online application, Squoosh.app.</p>

    <h4 class="step">Find the Files</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Open VS Code to your course repository folder.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the week01 folder. In this folder you will see:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>images.html</strong>: The html file where you will include your image.</li>
          <li>The <strong>images</strong> subfolder: This is the folder that contains the large image and where you will
            place your small image.</li>
          <li><strong>images/temple-large.jpeg</strong>: In the images subfolder, this is the large file that needs to
            be optimized.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="step">Optimize the image</h4>
    <p>There are many applications that can be used to edit and optimize images including those listed under
      <strong>Editing</strong> on this <a
        href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse-ww-program/resources/frontend-resources.html#images"
        target="_blank">resource site</a>. In this activity, you will be introduced to and use a free, online
      application named Squoosh.app.
    </p>


    <ol>
      <li>In your web browser, navigate to the online application, <a href="https://squoosh.app/"
          target="_blank">Squoosh.app</a>.</li>
      <li>Select the button in the middle of the page and upload the <strong>temple-large.jpeg</strong> file from your
        computer.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Edit</strong> panel on the right, toggle <strong>Resize</strong> and change
        the width to 800 pixels.</li>
      <li>Under <strong>Compress</strong>, try changing the file type and adjust the quality until the file is less than
        100KB.</li>
      <li>Click the download button (bottom right) to save the image to your computer. Change the name of the file to be
        <strong>temple-small</strong> with whatever file extension matches the format you selected and save it back in
        the <strong>week01/images</strong> folder.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="step">Update the html file to include your new image</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <strong>images.html</strong> file in the <strong>week01</strong> folder.</li>
      <li>Right-click the <strong>images.html</strong> file and open it in Live/Five Server.</li>
      <li>Notice how large the image is.</li>
      <li>Update the <code>img</code> tag in the html file to refer to your new image.</li>
      <li>View the page again in your browser and notice how much smaller the image is on your page.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <p>You do not need to submit anything yet for this learning activity. When you have finished the remaining learning
      activities for this week, you will return to Canvas to report on your progress.</p>
